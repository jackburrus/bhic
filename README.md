# BHIC

## Inspiration
### Soulbound tokens, identification, proof of humanity, memes

## What it does
### A soulbound erc-721 identity token where minters face is the image, and determines the attributes.

## How we built it
### Webcam + TensorFlow Attributes are based on TensorFlow assumed age, gender, emotion L1 base face + core attributes L2 mintable identity cards (todo) React, Solidity

## Challenges we ran into
### Tensorflow is not accurate

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
### Jack is proud of deploying and interacting with a contract on a live test network for the first time, as well as using TensorflowJS for the first time to predict user features. Rob is proud of exploring an interesting contradiction between anon and identity in a unique way

## What we learned
### We learned that getting up and running with TensorflowJS is quick and easy. Even though there are many services that offer no-code minting of NFT's deploying your own contract can take very little time as well.

## What's next for BHIC
### Extracting additional attributes that can be assumed by facial analysis, deploying the base NFT on l1, with different identification types on optimism.
